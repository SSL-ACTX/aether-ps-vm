# Security Policy

The security of this tool and, by extension, the code it protects, is taken very seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities or bypasses you discover.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security issues through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, a bypass for the obfuscation, or any issue that could compromise the integrity of the protections offered by Aether-VM, please report it to me privately via email at:

**[degozaru@protonmail.com]**

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible:

*   A clear description of the vulnerability or bypass technique.
*   A proof-of-concept or code sample demonstrating the bypass.
*   The version of Aether-VM affected.
*   Your name or alias for acknowledgment (if you wish to be credited).

## My Commitment

As a solo developer, I will do my best to:

*   Acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours.
*   Investigate the issue and confirm its validity.
*   Work on a patch to address the vulnerability.
*   Credit you in the release notes for your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping to improve the security of Aether-VM.
